Calling convention:
AMD64
The first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9 (R10 is used as a static chain pointer in case of nested functions[19]:21), while XMM0, XMM1, XMM2, XMM3, XMM4, XMM5, XMM6 and XMM7 are used for certain floating point arguments.[19]:22 As in the Microsoft x64 calling convention, additional arguments are passed on the stack[19]:22. Integral return values up to 64 bits in size are stored in RAX while values up to 128 bit are stored in RAX and RDX. Floating-point return values are similarly stored in XMM0 and XMM1

Instructions
movdqa - mov alignd double quadword
movzx - mov with zero extend
pcmpeqd - compare packed doublewords for equal
* pcmpeqd xmm0,xmm0 will make xmm0 all 1s
